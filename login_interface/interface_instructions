The interface lead will access the Web server and create a login page and a simple menu
with the sections of your website. One option of the menu should be repots and should
include the names of the reports required in your project. You do not need to implement the
reports, just include the link. The information for the login page will be hardcoded. You
should be able to login as an admin with the credentials id: admin, pwd: admin1 and as a
regular user with credentials id: user, pwd:user1. The menu for admin will be different from
the menu for user, admins will have an option to “add users”. You don’t need to implement
the “add users” option.
